# `Hi I am Kevin Saji`


!!! note "About Me"
    Born in Kerala and raised in Bangalore , I was always taught to value culture and traditions. I have always been an avid follower of history and it's role in modern life. The beautiful mix of old and new creates a charming blend as rich as a cup of espresso. I wish to keep that mix alive.

In the coming years, I aim to do good not only in my academic life but also in my social life. I want to make new friends and create a stable network that sticks by me. Hoping to create beautiful memories in the upcoming years.
