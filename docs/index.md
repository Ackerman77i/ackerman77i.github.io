# `Hi I am Kevin Saji`


!!! note "About Me"
	Hi! My name is Kevin Saji, and I’m a student at SRM Kattanakulathur. I was born in Kerala and raised in Bangalore and have always been interested in sports and video games. When I was younger, I would participate in out-door activities all day—and it wasn’t just for fun! It was because I wanted to. I’ve always loved playing football and kabaddi. I think they’re so fun and helped me bond with people ! And the best part is that they help in keeping my body very active and healthy. I’ve been working on a portfolio since high school but never finished it until recently. Now that I’m done with classes for this semester, I hope you’ll take a look at it!
